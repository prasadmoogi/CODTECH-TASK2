## Overview of the SUPEROO Calculator Program

- **Introduction**: 
  - Developed by Prasad.
  - Command-line based calculator program.

- **Features**: 
  - Performs basic arithmetic operations:
    - Addition (+)
    - Subtraction (-)
    - Multiplication (x)
    - Division (รท)
    - Modulus (%)
    - Exponentiation (^)

- **Function Definitions**:
  - `add(x, y)`: Returns the sum of `x` and `y`.
  - `subtract(x, y)`: Returns the difference between `x` and `y`.
  - `multiply(x, y)`: Returns the product of `x` and `y`.
  - `divide(x, y)`: Returns the quotient of `x` divided by `y` (handles division by zero).
  - `modulus(x, y)`: Returns the remainder of `x` divided by `y` (handles division by zero).
  - `exponentiate(x, y)`: Returns `x` raised to the power of `y`.

- **Main Program Loop**:
  - Greets the user with "Welcome to the SUPEROO Calculator!"
  - Repeatedly prompts for two numbers and an operation.
  - Performs the selected operation and displays the result.
  - Handles invalid inputs and division by zero.
  - Asks the user if they want to perform another calculation.
  - Ends the program when the user chooses not to continue.

- **User Interaction**:
  - Input prompts for two numbers.
  - Menu for selecting the desired operation.
  - Output displays the result of the selected operation.
  - Option to perform additional calculations or exit the program.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Checks for non-numeric inputs.
  - Handles division by zero gracefully with error messages.

- **Conclusion**:
  - Thanks the user for using the SUPEROO Calculator.
  - Ends the program when the user decides to stop.
